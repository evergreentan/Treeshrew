# Project Treeshrew
## Overview:

This repository serves as a documentation for data cleaning related to my third-year field paper. 

- Field paper: Information Technology and Sagging Employment Growth of Non-Routine Cognitive Occupations Since 2000
- Lauch date: 06/27/2016
 
## Datasets:

This section lists the main three datasets I have been working with for my field paper. I plan to redo all the data cleaning and analysis in python during the summer before my fourth year. 

- 1. Current Population Survey (CPS)
  - [ ] Monthly supplement
  - [ ] May/Outgoing retation group (MORG)
- 2. O*NET (Occupational Information Network)
  - [ ] O*NET 4.0 database
  - [ ] O*NET latest database
- 3. World KLEMS
  - [ ] U.S.

## Consistent Occupation/Industry Codes

This section documents how I follow Hudomiet (2015) and construct crosswalks mapping occupation/industry classifications between different datasets.

- 1. Occupaton
  - [ ] Crosswalk
- 2. Industry
  - [ ] Crosswalk
  
## Empirical Analysis

This section lists the regressions I run for the paper. The goal of the empirical analysis is to estimate the key structural parameters (the elasticity of substitution between tasks in goods production, goods demand elasticity, and task-specific technological change), decompose the employment share growth for NRC occupations to between-industry and within-industry components, and conduct some counterfactual exercises based on the estimated model.

- 1. Conditonal Labor Demand
- 2. Product Demand
- 3. Between-industry and Within-industry Decomposition
- 4. Counterfactual Exercises
  - [ ]  Predicted employment growth for NRC occupations
